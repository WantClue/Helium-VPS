By setting up a VPS on Linode you can download one of these installations scripts and they will do all the work you need.

Instant download and install by this command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WantClue/Helium-VPS/main/install.sh -O - | sudo bash
```

After downloading it you need to make sure it´s executable by the following command:
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
or for RUT240
```
chmod +x install-rut.sh
```

After this you just need to run the script by
```
./install.sh
```
or for RUT240
```
./install-rut.sh
```
Don´t forget to do the Port forwarding in your router(Mango,RUT240) afterwards
